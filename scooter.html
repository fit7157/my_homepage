    <h2 class="discription">
       We as a team discussed how we could improve school cafeteria system. We concluded 3 functions.<br/>
        1. Notify empty seats before students go into the cafeteria.<br/>
        2. Notify whether my food is prepared more conveniently compared to previous TV screen notification.<br/>
        3. Automatically opening trashcan  without physical touch.<br/>
        4. Smoke notification system.<br/>

    <div class="works">
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p> 
        <b>function 1 : Seat availability notification system.</b><br/>
        Problem: It was difficult to recognize whether there are empty seats available because the fodd ordering Kiosk located outside of the cafeteria, which menas it was impossible to know available seats when ordering fodd.
        Solution: We installed a ultra-sonic sensor at each seats and made a LED board that can turn red lights on in order to indicate ocuupied seats.<br/>
        <b>function 2 : Ready to serve food  notification system</b><br/>
        Problem: It was difficult to notice whether my food was cooked and ready to serve because students had to keep watching TV screene in order to know their number appears on the screen.</b><br/>
        Solution: We solved this problem in 3 steps. First  students get two cards after choosing food and seat on Kiosk. One card contains menu information and the other contains seat number.-> Next, the student taps those two cards on RFID machine.
        Then, the information of menu and seat are sent to kitchen.->Finally when the food is ready to serve, the cook enlights LED of the seat that belongs to the food using IR remote control. This can be done based on the seat and menu information that are sent to the kitchen.<br/>
        Now, the student easily recognizes that his food is ready just by seeing LED light that is located at each table.<br/>
        <b>function 3 : Touchless trash can</b><br/>
        Problem: Trashcan is located on the dish return place. However every students are actually holding their dishes when they try to use the trashcan.<br/>
        Solution: We used ultra-sonic sensor to indicate whether there is an obstacle in front of the trashcan. This enabled to open the trashcan just by waving hands on the trashcan.<br/>
        <b>function 4 : Smoking detection</b><br/>
        Problem: There is smoking area on the way out of the cafeteria. If there is an indicater that can identify whethere someone is smoking in the area, students may be able to take other route to go out.<br/>
        Solution: This was solved by using MQ2 sensor. when smoke is recognized in that area by MQ2 sensor, red LED turns on and students can see the LED before going to that area. They can choose other routes.<br/>
